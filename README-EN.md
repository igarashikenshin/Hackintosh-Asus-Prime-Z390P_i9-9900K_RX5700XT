### Tips:

1. The model needs to be set to iMAC19.1 (now preset, please modify it after installation).
1. The config defaults to no verbose mode. To enable verbose mode, config.plist needs to modify the following one: NVRAM-Add-7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82-boot-args, add -v.
1. The ScanPolicy value of the config boot disk policy is set to 0. Bootable Windows or Other OS (Linux, Unix) If you need to specify the search partition type, please refer to the OC configuration manual.
1. The config defaults to not display the OC Picker menu. To turn on the menu display, set as follows: Misc-Boot-ShowPicker is true (YES in the plist editor).
1. usbport.kext is remapping for me according to the motherboard wiring. If you have a USB-related error, you can remapping the usbport yourself, or cancel the loading of the kext, and set the XhciPortLimit value to true.


### Currently known issues:

1. Windows cannot be set as the startup disk in the startup disk (it prompts that the Bless tool cannot set this disk as the startup disk). Update-the problem has been resolved,you can view [Windows Bootcamp.pdf](https://github.com/igarashikenshin/Hackintosh-Asus-Prime-Z390P_i9-9900K_RX6800XT/blob/master/Boot%20Camp%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/Windows%20Bootcamp.pdf)
1. The boot conversion assistant is unavailable (it should be a problem with multiple hard drives, the function can be used normally according to the single hard drive). Update-This issue has been resolved, you can view [Windows Bootcamp.pdf](https://github.com/igarashikenshin/Hackintosh-Asus-Prime-Z390P_i9-9900K_RX6800XT/blob/master/Boot%20Camp%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/Windows%20Bootcamp.pdf)
